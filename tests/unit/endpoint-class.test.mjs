// endpoint-class — is an endpoint a READ or a WRITE? Pure.
//
// Guards the instrument itself. The old rule was "write := non-GET", and on the live target — which
// speaks POST-for-read — it reported 18 write endpoints when exactly ONE was a mutation. Several rounds
// of fixes were prioritized off that number. A classifier that cannot tell `POST /listnuggets` from
// `POST /updateusersettings` makes every downstream verdict about the run untrustworthy.
//
// Guards: a read verb travelling by POST classifies READ; an explicit mutation verb classifies WRITE
//   whatever the method; telemetry never counts as an application write; and a non-GET with no verb at
//   all is classified write but SURFACED as a fallback guess rather than asserted.
// FAIL-ON-REVERT: replace classifyEndpoint's body with the old method test
//   (`method === 'GET' ? 'read' : 'write'`) → "POST /rawcaster/listnuggets is a READ" fails.
