// SESSION-WIDE read-only WRITE-FIREWALL (docs/PHASE1-COLLECTION-PLAN.md §read-only). Distinct from the
// Layer-3 REPLAY firewall (reveal-firewall.mjs), which spans only a reveal-replay prologue: this one is
// installed for the WHOLE crawl session so a READ-ONLY recon walk is STRUCTURALLY unable to commit a write
// on a live authed account — the failure a live stateful rawcaster run just proved real (a `Follow` ICON
// with no English name slipped the name-based danger-floor and fired POST /rawcaster/followandunfollow, a
// real follow/unfollow mutation).
//
// ABORT-BY-DEFAULT (CTO blocker-1). The gate must block mutations WITHOUT breaking apps whose READS go over
// POST — rawcaster serves `listnuggets`, `getothersprofile`, `listevents`, `get_ad`, `getfollowlist` over
// POST and content never loads if those are aborted. The OLD firewall let ANY benign-named non-GET through
// (a POST /api/x123 with no write verb in its path reached the server); the fix INVERTS that. Each request
// classifies:
//   (a) GET / HEAD / OPTIONS                → CONTINUE (a read has no server side-effect).
//   (b) non-GET whose URL PATH matches WRITE_VERB_RE (an OBVIOUS mutation: /followandunfollow, /delete-…)
//                                           → ABORT + record {reason:'write-verb'}. Survives the operator
//                                              override — an obvious mutation is never continued.
//   (c) non-GET in the AGENT-JUDGED read-allowlist (a list/search over POST the agent classified `read`)
//                                           → CONTINUE + record {reason:'read-allowed'}. The ONLY widen.
//   (d) ANY OTHER non-GET                   → ABORT by default + record {reason:'write-blocked'}. A benign-
//                                              named write can no longer reach the server (the closed residual).
// OPERATOR OVERRIDE (--allow-benign-post, recon-run argv only, NEVER the agent): restores the old branch-(c)
// continue for zero-latency reach on a TRUSTED target — a non-GET that is neither a write-verb (b) nor an
// allowlisted read (c) is CONTINUED + recorded {reason:'non-get-allowed'}. Default OFF (abort-by-default).
//
// CAUSAL SAFETY: aborting at the network layer does NOT break causal capture. The probe's fetch/XHR
// monkeypatch records the fire the instant fetch() is CALLED (before the network), and CDP
// requestWillBeSent fires before the abort, so the token + initiator both still see the request — actStep
// records the control→endpoint edge (addTrigger) exactly as if it had completed. Only the SERVER side-
// effect is prevented; the API MAP is preserved (a blocked write still shows in the causal control→endpoint
// map, just with a null status).
//
// HONEST RESIDUAL (documented, not fixed here): an allowlisted READ whose method/body is later SWAPPED to a
// write on the SAME urlPattern (an adaptive server) is not caught — the allowlist keys on method+urlPattern
// (§8, same boundary reveal-firewall documents). The complementary NAME gate (danger-floor mutationFloor,
// opt-in at click time) catches a mutation-NAMED control firing a benign endpoint. Off-origin / danger-route
// are handled elsewhere (actStep, routeRefused, the reveal firewall) — this module is the WRITE gate.
//
// TRANSPORT BOUNDARY (open gap, security review M1): `page.route('**/*')` intercepts only HTTP(S) requests.
// A mutation sent over an OPEN WebSocket frame (`ws.send({action:'follow'})`) or a WebTransport stream is
// NOT seen by this gate — so on an app that mutates over raw WS, the "structurally read-only" contract holds
// only for HTTP(S), not for WS. The name gate (danger-floor) still refuses a mutation-NAMED control before
// the click, so a `Follow` control is stopped upstream regardless of transport; but a benign-named control
// firing a WS mutation is a residual. Closing it needs `page.routeWebSocket` with a read-vs-mutation frame
// policy (which client→server frames to drop without breaking a legit WS read-subscription) — deferred as a
// designed increment, NOT bolted on here. Until then this gate's guarantee is scoped to HTTP(S).
